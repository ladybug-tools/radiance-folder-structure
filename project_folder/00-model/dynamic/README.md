# aperture

`/00-model/dynamic`

`dynamic` folder includes all the dynamic geometries in a model. In most cases, apertures
are the dynamic parts of the model but you can also have dynamic indoor or outdoor
geometries. This structure helps to not only model dynamic blinds but also model
deciduous trees and snowy days by changing the ground modifier. 

In this sample model the `south window` is the only dynamic aperture in the model with
two states. See `/00-model/dynamic/aperture` for more information on how to define a
dynamic aperture.

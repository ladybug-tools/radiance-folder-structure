# Project folder

This is a proposal folder/ file structure for daylight studies.

## GOAL

The ultimate goal of this project is to provide an input data folder/ file structure that
can be used both by Radiance users and software developers. Using an standard folder
structure will makes it easy to use different tools/ scripts regardless of the source of
the files.

```shell
└─project_folder
    ├───0-model
    │   ├───aperture
    │   │   ├───dynamic
    │   │   └───static
    │   ├───bsdf
    │   └───etc
    │       ├───opaque
    │       │   ├───outdoor
    │       │   └───indoor
    │       └───non-opaque
    │           ├───outdoor
    │           └───indoor
    ├───1-lightsource
    │   ├───ies
    │   ├───sky
    │   ├───sun

    ├───2-sensorgrid

    └───5-postprocess
```

## Sample case

To make it easier to describe the folder structure we are using a room with 3 aperture
and a two part partition. For this example the files are generated by Honeybee[+] but
they could have been generated by any other interface for Radiance.

The south window is a dynamic aperture and has two states: 0: clear, 1: diffuse50. The
upper part of the window and the skylight are both static.

# Project folder

To make it easier to describe the folder structure we are using a room with 3 aperture
and a two part partition. For this example the files are generated by Honeybee[+] but
they could have been generated by any other interface for Radiance.

The south window is a dynamic aperture and has two states: 0: clear, 1: diffuse50. The
upper part of the window and the skylight are both static.

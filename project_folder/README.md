# Project folder

This is a sample project folder for Radiance. To make it easier to share the folder
structure we are using a room with 3 aperture and a two part partition.

For this example the files are generated by
[honeybee-radiance](https://github.com/ladybug-tools/honeybee-radiance)
but they could have been generated by any other interface for Radiance.

There are three apertures in this model:
1. The bottom part of the south window is a dynamic aperture and has two states:
    0: clear, 1: diffuse50.
2. The upper part of the window.
3. and the skylight.

# Radiance folder

This is a sample project folder for Radiance. To make it easier to share the folder
structure we are using a room with 3 aperture and a two part partition.

For this example is generated by
[honeybee-radiance](https://github.com/ladybug-tools/honeybee-radiance)
but they could have been generated manually or by by any other software.

There are three apertures in this model:

1. Bottom part of the south window: This is a dynamic aperture and has two states:
    0: clear, 1: diffuse50.
2. Upper part of the south window. This part of the window is a static aperture.
3. skylight: Skylight is also a static aperture.
